Instructions for using Picasa and organization of folders for DVD production.


Final DVD Layout

Main Menu (14 menu items max)
	SubMenu (9 menu items max)

A total of 14 x 9 = 126 image folders.

Each SubMenuDirX directory (or folder) contains a set of image files and will be referred to as a slideshow.
Each slideshow has a title screen, which consists of:
	1) title  (corresponds to Picasa's "Description" of a folder)
	2) background image (TITLE.JPG or the first image in the folder)

"MainMenuDir1", "MainMenuDir2", ..., "MainMenuDir14" are used as the labels for menu items in the Main Menu.
"SubMenuDir1", ..., "SubMenuDir126" are ONLY used as menu item labels in the SubMenu ONLY if a "Place taken" is not specified in Picasa's folder description.

(Note: All menu item labels can be edited later when generating the DVD.)
